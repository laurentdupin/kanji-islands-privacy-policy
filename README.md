Last updated January 24, 2023

This privacy notice for Hugo BOREL (doing business as HBLD Productions) ("HBLD
Productions," "we," "us," or "our"), describes how and why we might collect, store,
use, and/or share ("process") your information when you use our services
("Services"), such as when you:

▪ Download and use our mobile application (Kanji Islands), or any other
application of ours that links to this privacy notice
▪ Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events
Questions or concerns? Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your
privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please
do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us
at kanjiisland@gmail.com.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an
interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you
participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
We do not process sensitive information.
We will not disclose your information to any third party except if you expressly consent or where required by law.
When using the "Connecting with Google" feature to make an online backup of your save file (which does not contain any information about yourself or about your device), 
no information is collected by the Services, but Google may collect information on their side.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
further processing until deletion is possible.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security
and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to
and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
secure environment.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By
using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or
guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If
we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been
collected, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. 
If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at kanjiisland@gmail.com.

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be
indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as
soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be
informed of how we are protecting your information.

If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at
kanjiisland@gmail.com.
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, the "data controller" of your
personal information is Hugo BOREL. You can contact them directly regarding the processing of
your information by Hugo BOREL, by email at kanjiisland@gmail.com
